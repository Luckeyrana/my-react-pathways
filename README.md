# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# React Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal learning progress based on the official React docs with Vite (react.dev).  
Each folder represents a different concept I’ve practiced hands-on.

Feel free to explore — feedback always welcome! 

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
